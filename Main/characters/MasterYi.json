    "story": "Master Yi has tempered his body and sharpened his mind, so that thought and action have become almost as one. Though he chooses to enter into violence only as a last resort, the grace and speed of his blade ensures resolution is always swift. As the last living practitioner of the Ionian art of Wuju, Yi has devoted his life to continuing the legacy of his peopleâ€”scrutinizing potential new disciples with the Seven Lenses of Insight to identify the most worthy among them.",
